### Implementation of Computer Vision Algorithms on STL10 Dataset (Domain Specific Task)

#### Unsupervised Learning
  For the Unsupervised Learning part of the task , [Residual Deep Learning](ResNet_STL10.py) Algorithm has been Implemented for training on **5000** images for which an accuracy of around *65%* was achieved on the test dataset of **8000** images
  
#### Semi-Supervised Learning
  For the [Semi-Supervised learning algorithm](ResNet_STL10_SSL.py) the same base architecture used for Unsupervised Learning i.e., Residual Network which was combined with pseudo labeling 
  
#### Self Supervised Learning
